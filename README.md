# Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice Savegame Loader

This application acts as a level selector for the game, by replacing the current savegame file the game is using with another file at a certain checkpoint in the game.

There are a few predefined files, of moments in the game that I liked personally:
- Surtr's boss fight;
- Valravn 's boss fight;
- The bridge to Helheim fight sequence;
- One file for the Odin trials part, and one file for each trial individually;
- The sea of corpses entire sequence;
- Garmr boss fight;
- The bridge to Hela's boss fight sequence;
- Hela's boss fight.

You can add your own, though.

## Interface
![Program interface](/ui.jpg)

- Click the 'Load' button to replace the game's current file with the selected one.
- Through the 'Add new file' button you can add your own files to the selection list.
- The 'Backup current savefile' will create a copy of the current savegame file the game is using.
- If your game savegame files are not on the default folder ```(C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\HellbladeGame\Saved\SaveGames)```, you can change it with the 'Change save files folder location' button.
- 'Navigate to savegame files folder' will open the mentioned folder.
